Manual Tests:

User is at the login screen...

- Login screen looks visually complete - when trying on smaller devices / tablet
- Login with a valid username/password - user is sent to the News screen (logged in successfully)
- Login with a valid username/invalid password - should not be logged in, some form of messaging
- Login with a valid password/invalid username - should not be logged in, some form of messaging
- Login with an invalid format for username (valid password) - should not be logged in, some form of messaging
- Enter username and password and rotate device - values are still kept and not erased.
- Rotate device whilst signing in (valid username and password) - User is logged in successfully
- Attempt to login using different locale/region (Testing double byte characters and such)


Assume user is successfully logged in...
- User presses back and they are taken out of the application (not back to the login screen)
- Given there is no network connectivity or some error has occurred loading the feed - user is shown an error message
- Given there is poor network connectivity - the tiles are seen loading slowly (or user is at least shown a spinner whilst they load, the UI is still responsive)
- Large list is returned by the endpoint - device storage runs out as the images are loading (behaviour TBC?)
- No data returned from feed - no error is shown but the user is at the News screen, swiping does not do anything
- Invalid data returned from feed - no error is shown but the user is at the News screen, swiping does not do anything
- News 'tile' is returned the but the data is incomplete (missing link information) - User clicks on tile, but nothing happens
- View has many tiles loaded - user is able to swipe up/down the list ... the app does not crash.
- View has many tiles loaded - user is able to swipe up/down the list and they send the app to the background and resume
    ...the app does not crash and the user is returned to the same position in the list prior to sending the app to the background
- News 'tile' is returned with all data - User clicks on tile, user is taken to the configured browser (assuming one has been setup, otherwise they are prompted)

List verification...
- List may have duplicate items contained within it (i.e. duplicate image and/or same/different link to article)

Assume user is successfully logged in and has clicked on a tile where there are now at a browser...
- User is able to navigate back and is taken to the list of News tiles (assuming Feed data has not changed since)
- User is able to navigate back and is taken to an empty news list (assuming Feed data has changed since)
- User is able to navigate back and is taken to a News screen with an error message (assuming Feed data endpoint is now not valid or not returning data)


Other variations:
 - Different default browser configured (other than Chrome)
 - Different network connectivity (2G, 3G, High latency, etc)
 - Different devices and formats (different O/S versions, screen sizes, tablets, etc)
 - Availability of space on device (insufficient, sufficient)
